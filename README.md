# War
This project implements the classic "War" card game in two functional programming languages: **Haskell** and **Elixir**.

**Objective:** Simulate the game of War where two players draw cards from a shuffled deck and compete in turns. The player with the higher card wins the round and collects both cards. In the case of a tie (war), each player draws additional cards to break the tie. The game continues until one player has all the cards.

ðŸ’» Project Structure:
- war.hs: Haskell implementation
- war.ex: Elixir implementation
